		<h1> ABOUT </h1>
		<img class="aboutme" src="/images/self.png" width="190" height="340"></img>
		<p id="aboutme">Hi, I'm Tiffany. I'm an aspiring, self-taught programmer, fascinated by tech, obsessed with design, and eager to demonstrate my skills [Adobe Creative Suite, Media Research, Marketing, with a hint of HTML/CSS, Javascript, JQuery, and Ruby]. I hope to challenge media portrayals of women and gender disparity in tech by adding one more woman to the female developer population (while encouraging other women to learn more about coding, too!).</p>
		<p id="aboutme">I graduated summa cum laude from USC in 2014 and have been traveling, doing freelance work, and learning to program in earnest since then. </p>
		<p id="aboutme"><i>In case you wanted to know</i> In the past 8 months, I've lived in 4 countries (visiting 8). I make scrumptious smoothies, a mean mushroom marinara, tasty tacos, and a (nearly!) perfect pesto. I studied piano for over 10 years but my real passion is singing - I'm always down to sing jazz standards, show tunes, or Italian arias!</p>
